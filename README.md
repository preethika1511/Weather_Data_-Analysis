# Weather Data Analysis

## Overview
This project involves analyzing weather data using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy. Various data exploration, transformation, and statistical analysis techniques have been applied to gain insights from the dataset.

## Features
### Imported Libraries
- Imported essential libraries like Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.

### Loaded Data
- Loaded the weather data from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.

### Displayed Data
- Displayed the dataset to understand its structure and contents.

### Explored Data
- Checked the columns of the dataset.
- Identified unique values for wind speed.
- Counted the number of times weather was "Clear".
- Counted the number of times wind speed was exactly 4 km/h.

### Grouped Data
- Grouped data based on wind speed and displayed instances where wind speed was 4 km/h.

### Checked for Null Values
- Checked for missing values in the dataset.

### Renamed Columns
- Renamed the 'Weather' column to 'Weather Condition' for better readability.

### Dropped Columns
- Dropped the original 'Weather' column after renaming it.

### Calculated Statistics
- Calculated the mean visibility.
- Calculated the standard deviation of pressure.
- Calculated the variance of relative humidity.

### Filtered Data
- Found all instances when 'Snow' was recorded.
- Found all instances when 'Snow Showers' were recorded.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy


## Conclusion
